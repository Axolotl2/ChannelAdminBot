Hello, we're so glad you decided to use our application!

Don't forget to update the bot's token in the environment variable "ChannelAdminBotToken".
The installation can do it for you, but in order to change it you may need to uninstall and then install from scratch.

In order to create a new bot to use with this application please visit the following page:
